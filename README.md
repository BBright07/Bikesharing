# Bikesharing
To assess whether bike sharing would be a viable business in Des Moines a study was conducted. 
The study includes an assessment that will inform investors on the benefits of this project that has the potential
to improve health, environmental sustainability, and decrease urban congestion. 
By using August data, given that it usually has great weather, our study will show what's to be expected in Des Moines in terms of potential riders and business activity.
